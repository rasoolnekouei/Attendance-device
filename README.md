Attendance device For my coach volleyball academy
my coach asked me to design a devices for manage volleyball academy 
so that he can have a complete supervision of each player's tuition and record their entry and exit every day.

He needed the device to be connected to his personal site, so he could not use other devices in the market
I decided to design a device for him so that he can send an SMS to each player when the repayment deadline arrives and the coach can see who has paid their tuition.

For the frame of the device, I used plexiglass sheets and cut them with a laser machine.
To get the information of each player, I gave them a card with nfc feature and used an rc 522 module to get the information of the cards.
I also used a nodemcu to send information, and I have commented how to connect it to the rc 522 module in the codes.

 !If you find any bugs in the code, please let me know via commit!
